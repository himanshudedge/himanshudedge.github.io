<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As a research assistant at the RIVeR Lab at WPI I worked with three other underclassmen to develop a semi-autonomous mobile wheelchair. The first few weeks of the summer I familerizted myself with Python, Linux and ROS (Robot Operating System). The rest of the summer we retrofit a commercially avaliable wheelchair with the required components to allow for semi-autonomous operation of the wheelchair.</p>
