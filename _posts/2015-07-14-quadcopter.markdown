<h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
<p>I decided to build my quadcopter as a side project the summer of 2015. After a lot of research I was chose the quadcopter size I wanted to make and all the electronics I would need. To make the quadcopter mechanically different I decided to make the frame from scratch and also have the design be extremly modular. I designed the frame so it could be laser cut to allow me to quickly mass produce the parts. This also made making revisions to the design and implementing the designs very easy. I was able to finish the quadcopter and have it flying by the end of the summer. I got about a week of flying practice before I had to go back to school. As I was studying abroad the Fall 2015 semester progress on the quad has halted.</p>
<p>*Update* Jan 2016: Now that I am back on Tech's campus in Atlanta I should be able to keep working on the design!</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Ideation</h2>
<p>The first time I thought of building my own quadcopter was junior year of high school. We were selecting our Senior Independent Stuy Projects (SISP) and I thought it would be fun to build a quadcopter, and I would get to learn a lot at the same time. At the time however, I wasn't completely aware of exactly how to go about making the quadcopter, neither did I have adequte machining resources to complete the quad. I finally re-visited the idea of making the quadcopter at the end of freshman year at Georgia Tech. By that time I had gained enough machinning and technical knowledge needed to tackle this project.</p>
