<p> In 2012 my family bought our first DSLR, a Canon Rebel T3, as a family camera, but we only used it in the auto settings (an enormous waste of potential). At first I didn't use the camera much, but as time progressed I became increasingly interested in taking different types of pictures. Senior year of high school was when I officially began to hone my skills as a photographer. At the time I was enrolled as freshman at WPI. And one of the many perks of attending college as a high schooler was being able to take part in any of the clubs at the college. Luckily for me WPI had an exteremly active photography club that even had an dark room on campus! So I signed up for the club and began attending the meetings.</p>

<p>The first shoot was being held in the campus center in the evening after all the classes had ended. As I approched the room where we were meeting, I saw that the door was close. I could, however, see flashing lights from the small window in the door and hear lound techno music coming from the room. Thinking that couldn't possibly be the room, and maybe there was a last minute change I continued looking around the other rooms. They were all locked, so I decided to go back to room with the music and what I saw in there was completely unexpected.</p>

<p>Lucky for me it was the photo club's meeting. Firstly, all the lights in the room had been turned off and the only illumination was from two projectors which were projecting abstract patterns and aniations. This was a conference room, and there was a large table in t he middle of the room, on this table there was a girl from the photo club looking very aloof as she modeled for everyone else in the club. One projector was projected on the wall to create a surreal background, while the other projector was being shined on the model to create an almost dreamlike effect.</p>

<p>Overall it was a great shoot and I even got some cool photos out of it. I didn't have a tripod so I ended up having to shoot at high ISOs so the pictures were a bit grainy. Definately a great way to start off taking pictures. As I'm looking at the aperture I used while taking these pictures I'm not sure why I used such high f-stops. Ah well, I know better now.</p>
